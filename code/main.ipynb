    "To analyse theoretical time complexity, we take into account a few things.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. To enqueue the vertices: $ O (|V|) $\n",
    "Dijkstra's algorithm maintains a priority queue using the minimzing heap to store and retrieve the vertex with the smallest distance value. Hence, to enqueue all the vertices, it takes $O(|V|)$ time. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. To extract the minimum vertex from the heap: $ O (|V| * log|V|) $\n",
    "We know that the vertex with the smallest distance is placed on top of the heap. Once the element is extracted, the minimising order of the heap has to be restored. For this, the heap has to be traversed to check if the parent nodes are smaller than the children and switching them if not. \n",
    "\n",
    "This time complexity is equivalent to the height of the binary tree: $O (log(|V|)) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining this with the number of vertices $|V|$, we have : $O(V * log(|V|))$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Relaxing the edges, i.e., updating the shortest distance to a vertex: $O (|E| * log|V|)$\n",
    "When a shorter distance to a vertex is found, the priority of the vertex has to be updated in the priority queue. This involves the Decrease-key operation, which involves updating the vertex node in the tree and then restoring the minimising heap property. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is same as before and is equivalent to: $O (log(|V|)) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is done once for each of the edges in the heap, we then have $O (|E| * log|V|)$"

    "#### Hence, the total time complexity should be equal to: \n",
    "#### $O((|V| * log|V|) + (|E| * log|V|)) = O((|V|+|E|) * log |V|) $"
